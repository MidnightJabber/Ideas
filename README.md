### 1. DailyChrome - A chrome extension

**Aim** : To build a chrome extension which is user driven and user personalized that provides basic information about weather, time, to-do list, alarm clock, reminders, time-table, daily news, sports scores etc to the user.

**Abstract** : The idea is very similar to many new tab chrome extensions such as [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) or [Currently](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh?hl=en). Though these chrome extensions are good but they are not fully extensible. DailyChrome would provide more information to the user without him/her surfing through the web for the basic information for regular use. The application would also act as a self organizer for the user. Things like Todo-Lists, reminders and time-tables help do that. Another extended aim is to acheive all these goals without cluttering the new tab page. The user would be seeing that everytime a new tab is opened and hence it should be simple and clean to look at. A bonus construction within the application be that the user would be able to custom place by clicking and dragging smaller things like Sport scores, Todo-List etc across the page (optional).
